# Submarine

Submarine is a **WIP** PVR for Usenet and BitTorrent users.
It can monitor multiple feeds for new releases of your favorite shows and movies and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available (DVD -> Bluray as example).

Submarine is also heavily inspired by [Sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr/) & [Radarr](https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr/) and tries to polish already good working parts while iterating over the *not so good* working parts.
